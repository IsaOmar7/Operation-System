Q1:
One of the uses of PID namespaces is  the isolation, that means that process
with different PID's namespaces can have the same PID, thatâ€™s mean that PID
namespaces isolate the process ID number space because both process are in
different PID namespaces.
Q2:
When linux create sperate mount namespace that actually the isolation that mean
that each process in different mount namespace have different view to the
system mountpoint, that mean that different mount namespace have
different views for their own process.
Q3:
Linux cgroup allows allocation of system resources for groups to work on
one of these allocations is CPU or memory and etc.
Q4:
The use of clone is to create process/threads that run in Parallel in program
or in the same time in the same memory space, the difference between clone
and fork that fork calls allow the child process to share parts of its
execution context with the calling process.
Q5:
Chroot command is used to change the root directory of processes
and processes also mean their child process.
Q6:
The procfs provides a method of communication between kernel and user space,
for example the GNU version of the process reporting utility ps uses
the proc fs to obtain its data, without using any specialized system calls.
